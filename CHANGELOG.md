# Changelog

All notable changes to the AWS Architecture Diagram MCP server are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

- **Fix** — `export_pricing_json` referenced an out-of-scope `readFileSync` and threw
  on every call; the import is consolidated and the tool now works end to end. It also
  guards a missing file and passes `region` into each estimate line.
- Pricing handoff confirmed on the **AWS Pricing Calculator MCP**
  (`sample-aws-pricing-calculator-mcp`), which needs no AWS credentials; the browser
  payload now also emits `build_estimate` before `export_estimate`.

## [2.0.0]

- **Interactive HTML diagrams** — self-contained single file (React Flow), icons
  inlined as base64 so it works from `file://` and as an email attachment.
- **Data-driven containers** — declare arbitrary groups (`vpc`, `region`,
  `account`, `availability-zone`, `auto-scaling-group`, `on-premises`, …) with
  any nesting depth; models multi-VPC, multi-account, and hybrid architectures.
  Falls back to a derived single-VPC tree from each service's `subnet`.
- **Three layouts** — top-bottom, left-right, and radial (hub-and-spoke).
- **Architecture rationale** — attach ADRs (context/decision/consequences) and
  AWS Well-Architected pillar notes; shown in a Decisions panel and woven into
  the IaC handoff.
- **Typed connections** — `network` / `iam` / `event` / `data`, each styled
  distinctly; per-service `role` shown on click.
- **Flow execution** — play/step through ordered steps with speed control.
- **Exports** — PNG and editable `.drawio` from the browser; IaC handoff to the
  AWS IaC MCP and pricing handoff to the AWS Pricing Calculator MCP.
- **Icon resolution** — 347 AWS services mapped to official icons by name; icons
  are fetched at setup (not bundled — AWS Architecture Icons Terms of Use).
- 57 unit tests; CI on Node 18/20.
